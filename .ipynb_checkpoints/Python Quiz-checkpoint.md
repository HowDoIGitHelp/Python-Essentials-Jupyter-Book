   ```

7. ```python
   x = 3
   y = x + x
   x = y
   y
   ```

8. ```python
   x = 5
   (x < 0) and (x > 0)
   ```

9. ```python
   items = [1,2,3,4]
   items[items[2]]
   ```

10. ```python
    data = (1,2,3,4)
    data[len(data)-2]
    ```

11. ```python
    items = [1,2,3,4]
    items.remove(0)
    ```

12. ```python
    records = {'alpha':'beta', 'beta':'alpha'}
    records[records['beta']]
    ```
